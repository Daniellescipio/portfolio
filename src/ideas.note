user objects will have username, password, profile shape and color, points, and prizes
I'm thinking noSQL mongoDB
there were be a vending a machine game where users can purchase prizes. My idea is every so often, the vending machine will repopulate with random items. Super random. 
Like apples or your mom's love and Elvis's guitar, idk.
Prize objects will have a price and a name.
Users can only use the vending machine/get prizes if they have accounts. 
users can login and chose a profile shape and color
